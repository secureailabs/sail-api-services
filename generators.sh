# Rename all "_id" in openapi.json to "id"
# This is done because the openapi spec generates the keys of the models with "_id" instead of "id"
# It is not a bug, it happens because the openapi spec uses alias of the keys used in the models
# For example, if a model has a field called "id", it will be renamed to "_id", because that's what mongodb uses
# But _is is considered a private member so "id" is used instead
